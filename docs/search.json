I hold a Master of Science in Data Science for Public Policy (Hertie School) and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science (University of Bremen).\nMy dissertation examines how political elites view and semantically associate the terms “left” and “right” across the political spectrum. By using open-ended survey responses from federal election candidate surveys, I disentangle the associations of left and right and provide a methodological framework for a) measuring the attitudes and b) mapping ideological semantics by political position. Methodologically, I rely on different tools of applied text analysis, such as sentiment analysis and embedding-based methods to analyze the semantic structure.\nPreviously, among others, I held positions at POLITICO, the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, and the ParlGov database at the University of Bremen. Broadly speaking, my research interests include political behavior, political psychology, comparative politics, and computational social science.\nHere you can find my CV."

Political ideology is a cornerstone of political science, yet measuring how political actors view ideology remains challenging. This paper argues that the attitudes towards “left” and “right” ideologies are asymmetrically biased across the German political spectrum, with left-leaning elites holding positive views of “left” and negative views of “right,” a pattern not mirrored among right-leaning elites. By analyzing sentiment in open-ended responses from GLES candidate surveys (2013, 2017, 2021), the study finds a persistent “left bias” among German candidates, suggesting the need to reconsider the left-right continuum due to its impact on political behavior and representation.\n\nOpen Discourse: Towards the first fully Comprehensive and Annotated Corpus of the Parliamentary Protocols of the German Bundestag\n\nOpen Discourse is a comprehensive project that processes every word spoken in the German Bundestag’s parliamentary sessions into a machine-readable format, encompassing nearly 900,000 speeches from 1949 to 2022. This paper introduces the database, comparing it to other parliamentary text corpora projects and highlighting its potential for political research through modern quantitative text analysis and political science research frameworks."
