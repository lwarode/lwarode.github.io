## Research Papers

**Disentangling the Perception of Political Ideology among
Political Elites: Analyzing the Sentiment of German
Candidatesâ€™ Associations of Left and Right through
Open-Ended Survey Responses**

- (***Ongoing work -- Draft available upon request***). Political ideology is a cornerstone of political science, yet measuring how political actors perceive ideology remains challenging. This paper argues that the perception of "left" and "right" ideologies is asymmetrically biased across the German political spectrum, with left-leaning elites holding positive views of "left" and negative views of "right," a pattern not mirrored among right-leaning elites. By analyzing sentiment in open-ended responses from GLES candidate surveys (2013, 2017, 2021), the study finds a persistent "left bias" among German candidates, suggesting the need to reconsider the left-right continuum due to its impact on political behavior and representation.

[**Open Discourse: Towards the first fully Comprehensive and Annotated Corpus of the Parliamentary Protocols of the German Bundestag**](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dx87u)

- Open Discourse is a comprehensive project that processes every word spoken in the German Bundestag's parliamentary sessions into a machine-readable format, encompassing nearly 900,000 speeches from 1949 to 2022. This paper introduces the database, comparing it to other parliamentary text corpora projects and highlighting its potential for political research through modern quantitative text analysis and political science research frameworks.
