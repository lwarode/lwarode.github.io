::: {#hero-heading}
Welcome!

I am a **PhD student in Political Science** at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES), University of Mannheim. I hold a **Master of Science in Data Science for Public Policy** (Hertie School) and a **Bachelor of Arts in Political Science** (University of Bremen).

My dissertation examines **how political elites view and semantically associate the terms "left" and "right"** across the political spectrum. By using open-ended survey responses from federal election candidate surveys, I disentangle the associations of left and right and provide a methodological framework for a) measuring the attitudes and b) mapping ideological semantics by political position. From a theoretical perspective, I argue and theorize that the political context, namely political positions and legacies, matters for how ideology is viewed ans associated. Methodologically, I rely on different tools of applied text analysis, such as sentiment analysis and embedding-based methods to analyze the semantic structure.

Previously, among others, I held positions at [**POLITICO**](https://pollofpolls.eu), the [**WZB Berlin Social Science Center**](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy), and the [**ParlGov**](https://www.parlgov.org/) database at the University of Bremen. Broadly speaking, my research interests include political behavior, political psychology, comparative politics, and computational social science.

Here you can find my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQsxz0JA8AbX9khEoun_SNdJzact1KNo/view).

<!-- I'm mostly interested in **RWD (real-world data)**, such as hospital **Electronic Health Record** and large public health registry data. I develop [ggehr](https://andreaczhang.github.io/ggehr/), a ggplot2 extension to visualizing EHR data. -->

<!-- In 2020-2022, I worked as part of the COVID emergency response at the [Norwegian Institute of Public Health](https://www.fhi.no/en/). I helped develop the open source real-time analysis and public health surveillance system, **Sykdomspulsen** (now [CSIDS](https://www.csids.no)). I am co-leading [CAMIS](https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/) working group.  -->

<!-- As a part-time lecturer, I teach **statistics with R and Quarto** at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology ([OCBE](https://www.med.uio.no/imb/english/research/centres/ocbe/)) and **R programming** at the [Carpentries workshops](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/carpentry-uio/) at UiO. -->

<!-- I enjoy cooking and spending time in the mountains. -->
